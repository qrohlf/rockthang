# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Polpulate the database with information from the Morning Glory Wall at Smith Rocks
# Morning Glory Wall was chosen because it is popular, contains a wide variety of grades,
# and it is primarily sport climbs so the system's lack of ability to track trad climbs
# is less of an issue

# helper function to make creating single pitch climbs less of a chore

    #puts "Creating single pitch climb named #{name} with difficulty #{Pitch.difficulty_to_rating(difficulty)}"
    Climb.create(name: name, pitches: [Pitch.create(difficulty: difficulty)])
